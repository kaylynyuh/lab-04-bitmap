## Description

For this assignment you will be building a Bitmap reader and transformer. It will read a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your project should include tests, as well as a Gulpfile and package.json file, eslintrc, README.md, and a .gitignore. Make sure to run all your code through eslint. The process will look something like this:

1. open file using fs and read it into a buffer
2. convert buffer headers data into a Javascript Object (using constructors)
3. Run a transform on the buffer directly
4. Write the buffer to a new file.

The wikipedia article found here [Bitmap Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) describes the byte specification of a "windows bitmap file." We'll be working the simplest version, meaning no compression.

* Your project should have three transforms
* Invert the colors (essentially subtract every color value from the max color value which is 255),
* Grayscale the colors, multiply each color value by a constant, just make sure your values don't go over 255.
* (red|green|blue)scale the colors, same as above but only multiply one of the colors.

## Bonus Points:

* Can handle palette and non-palette bitmaps
* Can handle multiple types of bitmaps (not just BM)
* Handle LE and BE computers with a single if statement
* create a command line interface
* command line interface that can select the transform
* can handle various sized bitmaps
